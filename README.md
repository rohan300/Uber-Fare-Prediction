# Uber-Fare-Prediction
I will be conducting regression analysis on a dataset of Uber trips in New York to predict the fares of potential trips. The dataset is available here. It is a subset of a larger dataset provided as a dataset for a competition which is available here.

My goal is to train a machine learning model that can accurately predict the fare of an Uber taxi ride given relevant information such as the pickup and drop-off longitude and latitude, time of day, and distance traveled. To do this, we will use regression techniques to build a model that can make continuous predictions.

In this project, I will try to cover the following steps:

Data preparation, cleaning and exploratory data analysis
Model selection and training
Model evaluation and improvement
By the end of this project, I hope to have a predictive model that can be used to estimate Uber fares with high accuracy.
